I received my doctor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Fudan University in June 2022. Since December 2022, I have been an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Donghua University. I have published over ten papers in top conferences and journals. Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for several renowned publications and conferences, including IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, IEEE-ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, Neurocomputing, ICASSP, and ICME. My main research areas include cross-modal information processing and retrieval, natural language processing, and audio/music signal processing.
